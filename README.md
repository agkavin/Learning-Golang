# Learning Go - A Fun Journey!

Hey there! 👋

Welcome to my **Learning Go** repository, where I’ve been having a blast with the basics of Go (Golang). 🚀

In this collection of small projects, I’m recording my journey from figuring out what the heck Go is, to successfully making programs that actually work! 🛠️ From simple “Hello World” prints to understanding data types, functions, and packages — this is where I show off what I’ve learned (and maybe some things I didn’t fully understand yet 😅).

## Folder Breakdown:

- **projects**: This folder contains various mini projects that I’ve worked on. Each folder here focuses on a different topic or concept in Go.

- **pkg**: A folder for any custom packages I’ve created, like my `calc` package for basic calculations.

- **go.mod**: Go module file, because every Go project needs one, right?


## How to Run It

1. Clone the repo.
2. Run `go mod tidy` to set up dependencies.
3. Go into any project folder and run `go run main.go` to see the magic happen!

That’s it! Enjoy exploring, and feel free to laugh at my first attempts at Go coding 😂
